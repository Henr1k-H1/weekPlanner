# weekPlanner

This iOS app and widget lets the user creates tasks. Tasks can then be dragged and dropped onto a day of the week.

The app only allows one task per day. The initial idea was to manage seven tasks during a week that may depend on one another or need to be spread out with other tasks in-between.

The concrete example was to create a workout schedule with rest days and non-repeating stress on the same body parts two days in a row while determining how many sessions per exercise per week should be completed.
